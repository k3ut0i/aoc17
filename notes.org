* Advent of Code 2017 - Late practice

** Day 1
   Even the basic IO is so convoluted that to run a hello world program it compiles 130 modules. There are a lot of utilities not defined here. I am trying to define a read-number function from a string. Haven't used this in the problem.
   Got stuck trying to destruct on equality of two characters.
   By luck found out about ~Data.Char.â‰ˆ?~ which is the decidable instance of character equality. So I have partly solved the first part of the problem. I did not compare the last and first characters of the input in the program, So I have checked it manually and gave me the correct answer.
   #+begin_src sh :exports results :results output verbatim
     cd src/
     ./day1
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1039
